## DeVry Website
This repository is an e-commerce site that I created while working at ion exhibits. It needed to built very quickly as DeVry wanted to get this online ASAP however, without having the final products determined. As such I created the site using a flat file content management backend. This feature made easy to update and or add products in a quick and efficient manner. The bulk of the site is writen in php and javascript with some use of jquery. Additionally there is some html and css. I as well used Adobe suite to edit and create a number of graphics as well PDF's.
